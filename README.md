# Sharp Variance Bounds
Package to calculate a consistent estimate of the sharp variance bound for general regression-adjusted estimators of the average treatment effect in two-arm randomized controlled experiments. This variance estimate can be used to construct the asymptotically narrowest conservative Wald-type confidence interval with the nominal coverage for general regression adjusted estimators for the treatment effect. For more details, see [(Mikhaeil and Green, 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00191).

See vignette for examples.
