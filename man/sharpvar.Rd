\title{Estimation of Sharp Variance Bounds for Randomized Controlled
Experiments.}
\usage{
sharpvar(r_obs, Z, upper = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_obs}{The residuals of the outcome model \eqn{Y_i(q) - \hat f_q(X_i)}.}

\item{Z}{Vector of the treatment assignment.}

\item{upper}{Logical argument: Determines if upper (TRUE) or lower (FALSE) bounds will be calculated.}
}
\value{
Estimate of upper or lower sharp variance bound
}
\description{
This function calculates a consistent estimate of the sharp variance bound
for general regression-adjusted estimators of the average treatment
effect in two-arm randomized controlled experiments.
This variance estimate can be used to construct the asymptotically narrowest conservative Wald-type
confidence interval with the nominal coverage for general regression adjusted estimators for the
treatment effect. For more details, see \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00191}{(Mikhaeil and Green, 2024)}
